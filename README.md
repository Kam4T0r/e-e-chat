this is just like normal js-py chat but client is written in rust, has many problems and isn't done yet

chat is encrypted end-to-end (i hope so) and was (is going to be) tested by court expert

encryption is made using XSalsa20-Poly1305 method which is faster than AES

server doesn't have (yet) ability to decrypt messages so if you don't have a code just fuck off

you can generate and paste key using website in keygen folder

she doesn't love me 

server was made using npm modules node, httpserver and websocket so to use it type "npm i" and it will automaticly install all obligatory modules

good job fixing this shit

hope you enjoyed reading this

port 2208 was not haphazard
